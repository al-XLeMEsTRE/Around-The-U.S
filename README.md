# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Overview

Welcome to "Around The U.S.", a responsive web project that adapts smoothly to popular screen sizes for an optimized user experience. This endeavor is part of a rigorous coding journey that hones skills and challenges developers with complexities akin to real-world scenarios.

### Features

- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- Interactive UI elements with hover states
- Semantic HTML and modern CSS practices
- Compliance with design specs provided in Figma

### Figma

The project's design was provided through Figma, a collaborative interface design tool. Here's the [link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1), showcasing the meticulous layout planned for different viewport sizes.

### Images

Images were exported from Figma to ensure precision and detail, matching the design specifications. They were optimized using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to enhance the project's performance without sacrificing quality.
